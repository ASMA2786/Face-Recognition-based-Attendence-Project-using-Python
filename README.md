# Face-Recognition-based-Attendence-Project-using-Python
A Streamlit-based automated attendance system built with Python that utilizes OpenCV and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for real-time face recognition via webcam. This project demonstrates hands-on computer vision techniques, allowing automatic attendance marking by detecting and recognizing faces with ease. The solution helps eliminate manual attendance errors and saves time in educational or workplace environments.

Key technologies used: Python, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Streamlit
